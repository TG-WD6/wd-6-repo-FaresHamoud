Wat zijn de eigenschappen van block boxes en inline boxes?



1. block boxes: the box will move to another line when needed, the box would extend and fill the entire width, width and height of the box will be respected, margin, padding and border will push other bloxes aways

2. inline boxes: they will not break to a new line when taking space, their height and width will not be respected, their margins, padding and borders will be adjusted but not push the other boxes away.

padding, margins, and borders on the horizontal axis will be applied and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box
