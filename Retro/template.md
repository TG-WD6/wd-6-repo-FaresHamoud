# Retro Week \1

## Wat ging goed
1. team work and bringing all memebers of the group to a similar level with the asiignment, indiviudally hgetting help when stuck somewhere
2. managing the time and prioritize the tasks we had to do for the assignments
3. doing a recap at the end of day to discuss how was the work flow and where we stand, and what to be adressed in the next day


## Wat ging er minder goed
1. not having a clear idea where to start or what to prioritize hen it comes to learn new materials needed to complete assignments "git branching"
2. spending so much time and effort on learngitbranching, getting too focused on it was not necessary because it is more of an abstract way to learn the basic concepts of git, and sometimes it was more managable to execute the git commands in a terminal on an actual git repository
3. managing time and stick to the breaks, at some moments i was a bit anxious about the learnGitBranching excercises and kept trying to finishing during breaks
4. organizing the study materials and have a clear overview of the resources needed to finish them, opened the fundementals folders sometimes on git hub, sometimes as a code in VSC, it can be distracting at times and not so effecient to do so
5. spending too much extra time in the evening to resolve issues that i had when learning during the day, some days did not get enough sleep and rest

## Actiepunten voor volgende week
* better organise the learning materials
* try different ways to learn a cetrain topic without focusing too much on one source or approach
* better time managemen and have enough rest and sleep schedule
