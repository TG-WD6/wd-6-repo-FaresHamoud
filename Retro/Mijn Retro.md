# Retro 27_1 -7-2022

## Wat ging goed
1. finishing basic assignments (without the bonus) went well

2. got faster at trying different solutions even if some did not work in the end, learned what does not work , not only what works


## Wat ging er minder goed
1. got stuck on setting up some new things (JSON) data
2. found out that i had forgot some things and skills learned earlier, it costs time to revisit them again in orer to advance furthur in the corriculum 


## Actiepunten voor volgende week
* make sure to understand and finish current objects in order to move on to the next
* ask more for different opinions and get a different point of view by tutors or classmates
