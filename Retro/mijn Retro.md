# Retro Week \4

## Wat ging goed
1. class mates helped me by looking at my code and noticing typos and bad practices at a glance



## Wat ging er minder goed
1. it took me a longer period to understand sass, started  late on the Eindopdracht
2. understanding excercies and topics is one thing, but aplying them in a bigger project is another thing.
3. too much planning sometimes dosen't help when starting working on a project, i found that the structure i planned didn't help and sometimes was an obstacle in the way of finishing the assignment.

4. rarely asked for help bacause i thought what i was not understanding is a very simple and basic skill, something i need to get a good grip on before facing a problem that actually demands asking for help.
5. underestimated the diffuculty of certain tasks in the project, they took much more time and effort to finish

## Actiepunten voor volgende week
* better organise the task and planning ahead
* ask more for help, classmates or instructor
* not to work at the same time on all parts of a project, it leads to much more complications and slow down the progress
